# Grocery-Store-Web-Page

•Creating an HTML form with inputs for user name and password. Then styling them with CSS.
•After create the login template, connect to the MySQL database, implement login authentication, and define session variables.
•Then I come to the python file and adding the authentication code to the route method that I implemented.
•When an user wants to logout, then he/she have to remove the session variables that were created when the user logged in.
•I created registration system that users can use to register on the web page, where its main function is to create a new register route and the registration template, along with the registration form, which consists of input fields, submit button, etc.
• To proceed further I create the "register" route, which handles the POST request and inserting a new account to the accounts table, but only if the submitted fields are valid.
•Then the above web page is successfully created with HTML/CSS (frontend), PYTHON(backend) and MYSQL database.
